_"The edges of a city's defined borders don't really mean all that much when they
bleed into yet more urbanity." â€“ [Nate Berg](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/09/search-uniform-way-define-city/3165/)_ 

The short version
--

Metropolitan areas for the Where On Earth (WOE) hierarchy derived from Natural
Earth (NE) urban areas. Read: Polygons

New WOE IDs have been minted using one of three artisanal integer providers:
[Mission Integers](http://www.missionintegers.com/), [Brooklyn
Integers](http://www.brooklynintegers.com/) or [London
Integers](http://www.londonintegers.com/).

_This is very much a work in progress._

The longer version
--

_I still need to write it._

A word about Github
--

In the long-run Github may not be the best venue for managing all of these
records. But it's not an entirely crazy idea either so we're going to try it for
a while because it's easy and safe.

To do
--

* Reverse geocode all the edges of the geometries for each record to at least
  the country level, if not state. As of this writing there is a hierarchy of
  places (state, country) for each record based on their geometry's centroid.

* Figure out the list of children for each record.

* Try to work out place names for each (some?) record.
